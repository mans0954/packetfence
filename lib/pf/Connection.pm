=item _attributesToString

We create a printable string based on the connection attributes which will be used for display purposes and 
database storage purpose.

    my ( $this ) = @_;

    my $type = $this->transport;

    # SNMP is kind of unique and can only apply on a wired connection without anything else
    $type .= ( (lc($this->transport) eq "wired") && ($this->isSNMP) ) ? "-SNMP" : "";

    # Handling mac authentication for both NoEAP and EAP connections
    if ( $this->isMacAuth ) {
        $type .= "-MacAuth";
        $type .= ( $this->isEAP ) ? "-EAP" : "-NoEAP";
    }

    $type .= ( $this->is8021X ) ? "-8021X" : "";

    $this->type($type);

=item _stringToAttributes

We set the according attributes based on the printable string received in parameter.

    ( lc($type) =~ /^macauth/ ) ? $this->isMacAuth($TRUE) : $this->isMacAuth($FALSE);

    # We check if EAP
    # (We do this check using NoEAP because we don't want to fetch EAP in NoEAP string... you know!)

    ( lc($type) =~ /^8021x/ ) ? $this->is8021X($TRUE) : $this->is8021X($FALSE);

Only for backward compatibility while we introduce the new connection types.

    # mac authentication over EAP.
    # We use the User-Name RADIUS Access-Request attribute to differentiate both of theses scenarios. Since mac authentication use
    # the mac address as username, we can assume that we are dealing with a mac authentication connection if these two attributes
    # are equals.
