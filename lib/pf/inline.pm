=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over

=item new

Constructor.
Usually you don't want to call this constructor but use the pf::inline::custom subclass instead.

=cut

    my $this = bless {}, $class;
    $this->{_technique} = get_technique();
    return $this;
}

=item get_technique

Instantiate the correct iptables modification method between iptables and ipset

=cut
