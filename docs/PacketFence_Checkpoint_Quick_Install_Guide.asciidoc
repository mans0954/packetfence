About this Guide
----------------
This guide has been created in order to help sales engineers, product managers, or network specialists demonstrate the PacketFence capabilities on-site with an existing or potential customer.  It can also provide guidelines to setup a proof of concept for a potential PacketFence deployment using the *Checkpoint firewall*.

Assumptions
-----------
* You have a configured PacketFence environment with working test equipment;
* You have a Checkpoint firewall.


Quick installation
------------------
Step 1: Enabling Identity Awareness on the Security Gateway
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To enable Identity Awareness:

1. Log in to 'SmartDashboard'.
2. From the 'Network Objects tree', expand the 'Check Point branch'.
3. Double-click the 'Security Gateway' on which to enable 'Identity Awareness'.
4. In the 'Software Blades' section, select 'Identity Awareness' on the 'Network Security tab'.
The 'Identity Awareness Configuration' wizard opens.
5. Select 'one or more options'. These options set the methods for acquiring identities of managed and
unmanaged assets.
6. Select 'AD Query - Lets the Security Gateway seamlessly identify Active Directory users and computers' and click Next.
The 'Integration With Active Directory' window opens.
7. Select the Active Directory to configure from the list that shows configured LDAP account units or create a new domain. If you have not set up Active Directory, you need to enter a domain name, username, password and domain controller credentials.
8. Enter the Active Directory credentials and click Connect to verify the credentials. (Important - For AD Query you must enter domain) administrator credentials.
9. Click Finish.

Step 2: Enabling RADIUS Accounting on a Security Gateway
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To enable RADIUS Accounting for a Security Gateway:
1. In the 'SmartDashboard Network Objects tree', open the Security Gateway.
2. On the 'General Properties' page, make sure that the Identity Awareness Blade is enabled.
3. On the 'Identity Awareness' page, select RADIUS Accounting.

Step 3: Configuring RADIUS Accounting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In the 'Check Point Gateway' window > 'Identity Awareness' panel, click 'Settings' (to the right of the RADIUS Accounting option).
2. In the 'RADIUS Accounting Settings' window, configure the 'Message Attribute Indices' like this:

[options="compact"]
* *Device Name*: Calling-Station-Id (31) (Mac Address of the device)
* *User Name*: User-Name (1) (Username put on the PacketFence Portal)
* *Device Name*: Framed-IP-Address (8) (IP Address of the device in the production network)

Step 4: RADIUS Client Access Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gateway interfaces must be authorized to accept connections from PacketFence RADIUS Accounting.

To select gateway interfaces:
1. In the 'RADIUS Client Access Permissions' section, click Edit.
2. Select 'All Interfaces - All Security Gateway interfaces can accept connections from RADIUS Accounting clients'.
3. Leave the default port to 1813.
4. Click OK on both windows to submit the configuration.
5. Select 'Policy' > 'Install' from the SmartDashboard menu.

Step 5: LDAP Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure that you have the correct LDAP Objects created on the Checkpoint.

Step 6: SSO Configuration in PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to *'Configuration' -> 'Firewall SSO' -> 'Add Firewall' -> 'Checkpoint' *.

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your Checkpoint firewall
* *Secret or Key*: secret (radius shared secret)
* *Port*: 1813
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO with

Step 7: Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can check the correct log in with the SmartView Tracker under *'Network & Endpoint Queries' -> 'Predefined' -> 'Identity Awareness Blade' -> 'Login Activity'*
