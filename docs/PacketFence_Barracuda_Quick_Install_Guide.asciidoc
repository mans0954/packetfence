About this Guide
----------------
This guide has been created in order to help sales engineers, product managers, or network specialists demonstrate the PacketFence capabilities on-site with an existing or potential customer.  It can also provide guidelines to setup a proof of concept for a potential PacketFence deployment using the *Barracuda firewall*.

Assumptions
-----------
* You have a configured PacketFence environment with working test equipment;
* You have a Barracuda firewall.


Quick installation
------------------
Step 1: Configuration of the Barracuda in PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go to *Configuration -> Firewall SSO -> Add Firewall -> Barracuda*.

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your Barracuda
* *Firewall type*: Barracuda (Barracuda = SSH requests)
* *Password*: secret
* *Port*: 22
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO

Step 2: Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For our example, when the user registers on the portal it will be registered and the role staff will be assigned. The PacketFence server will send a request to the Barracuda database.

If you want to see if it's working, open an SSH access to your Barracuda and run this command following commands:

  acpfctrl auth show

You will get that:

  [root@baracudafw:~]# acpfctrl auth show
  1 entries
  172.20.20.152/0
  origin=PacketFence
  service=PacketFence
  user=Jdoe
