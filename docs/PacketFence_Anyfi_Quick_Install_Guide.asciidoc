About this Guide
----------------
This guide has been created in order to help sales engineers, product managers, or network specialists demonstrate the PacketFence capabilities on-site with an existing or potential customer.  It can also provide guidelines to setup a proof of concept for a potential PacketFence deployment using Anyfi products.

The instructions are based on version {release_version} of the PacketFence Live Image.

Assumptions
-----------
* You will need a USB key with a capacity of at least 4GB;
* You will need a laptop or a PC from which the PacketFence Live USB key will run from;
* You will deploy a VLAN enforcement environment according to the customer specifications;
* Your customer will provide the network equipment (switch, cabled, etc) to interconnect this PoC setup;
* You have either physical or virtual infrastructure to deploy the Anyfi Gateway and Controller;
* You have an access point that supports CarrierWRT.

Quick Deployment
----------------
Step 1: Pre-load
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This step is only necessary in the case you don't already have a pre-loaded PacketFence USB key. If you already have one, proceed to step 2, otherwise, follow these quick and simple instructions to pre-load a new USB key with PacketFence.

NOTE: The following process will remove everything from the USB key so if you currently have stuff on it, make sure to do backups!

Download the PacketFence USB key image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Make sure you have the latest version of the PacketFence USB key image.

Write the PacketFence image to the USB key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To write the PacketFence image on a USB key, you'll need to use a third-party application that will provide you with a graphical interface to do so.

Go to https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/0.6/0.6/+download/win32diskimager-binary.zip. That will download the necessary application. Once downloaded, extract the zip file.

Make sure your USB key is plugged into the PC then open up the folder where you extracted the application and double-click the `Win32DiskImager.exe` file.
Once done, simply choose the PacketFence USB image file (unzipped .img file), choose the device on which you want to write and click Write.

Step 2: Configure Network and PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The next step is the network setup and the PacketFence configuration. The following step is usually performed when you arrive at a customer site. Sometimes, you will know the network settings in advance, sometimes not. If you want to save time, you should ask/tell the client what is needed in order to have the demonstration running smoothly. That way, you will be able to preconfigure the PacketFence environment prior arrival.

Preliminary Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here is a quick list of questions to ask to a customer in order to easily configure a PacketFence environment:

1. What is the VLAN ID and subnet to be used for a registration VLAN? (ie. VLAN ID 2, Subnet 192.168.2.0/24)
2. What is the VLAN ID and subnet to be used for an isolation VLAN? (ie. VLAN ID 3, Subnet 192.168.3.0/24)
3. What is the VLAN ID of the production VLAN? (ie. VLAN ID 10)
4. A list of production DHCP server(s) (for rogue DHCP detection)

Steps for the customer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some steps needs to be taken by the customer for having the network ready. Here is a list of what we think should be ready for a demo:

* 1 TRUNK port to connect the demonstration PC which will run the PacketFence environment. The native VLAN should be a management VLAN that will be used for communication between the equipment and the environment
* 1 TRUNK port to connect the controller
* 1 TRUNK port to connect the AP

Configuring your PacketFence environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simply plug the previously created USB key in one of the demonstration PC USB port. You will have to make sure the PC will boot from the USB key (it is usually a pre-boot option or a setting in the BIOS).

Before booting, make sure the network cable coming from the TRUNK port for the demonstration PC is correctly plugged in the switch and the PC and that the link is up.

Once powered, the PC will boot from the USB key and will automatically get to a graphical user interface with an opened web browser prompting for PacketFence configuration. The configuration process is a five steps process at the end of which, the USB key will be a persistent working PacketFence environment.

Step 1: Enforcement
+++++++++++++++++++
The first and most important step of the configuration process. This is where you'll choose the enforcement technique; either VLAN (out-of-band), INLINE (in-band) or both of them.

The choice(s) made on this step will influence the next step where you'll need to configure the different networks.

Each enforcement mode has its own required interface types that you'll have to configure on step 2.

For our customer scenario, we'll choose 'VLAN enforcement'.

Step 2: Networks
++++++++++++++++
This step will ask you to statically configure your network interfaces (note that DHCP interfaces configuration is not supported yet).

Depending on the choice(s) made on step 1, you'll have to configure the required types of interface. The web interface will list all currently installed network interfaces on the system. An IP and a netmask will be visible if the network interface is configured (either by DHCP or already manually configured). You can edit those ones, create/delete VLANs on physical interfaces and enable/disable an interface. Note that theses changes are effective on the moment you make them. Persistance will be written only for 'enabled' interfaces.

In all time, you'll need to set a 'Management' interface.

Required interface types for inline enforcement:

* Management
* Inline

Required interface types for VLAN enforcement:

* Management
* Registration
* Isolation

Note that you can only set ONE (1) management interface. This one will work for both in the case you choose both modes.

In our customer scenario, we will create two new vlans on the wired interface (will be `eth0` most of the time).
To do so, click the 'Add VLAN' button besides the wired interface for each of the needed VLAN:

Here's a sample configuration for both of them:

'Registration'

    Virtual LAN ID: 2
    IP Address: 192.168.2.1
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0

'Isolation'

    Virtual LAN ID: 3
    IP Address: 192.168.3.1
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0

Don't forget to also edit the physical interface with the correct management network information by clicking the 'Edit' button next to it.

According to our customer scenario, we'll associate the correct type the each interfaces.

* `eth0`: Management
* `eth0 VLAN 2`: Registration
* `eth0 VLAN 3`: Isolation

Make sure that those three (3) interfaces are in an 'enabled' state for the persistance to occur.

We also need to set the 'Default Gateway' which will generally be the gateway of the management network.

Once everything's set, click 'Continue' to proceed with the next step.

Step 3: Database Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This step will configure the MySQL server needed by PacketFence. Database and schema will be created as well as the necessary user for operations. Root account will also be secured if necessary (set a password and disallow remote login).

Since Debian based MySQL installations are not "secured", we'll need to go through it.
That step is fairly simple to accomplish and is a one time deal.

In the root account credentials section, enter root as Username and click 'Test'. You'll be prompted for a new root password. Choose a password for the MySQL root user and click 'Save'. You can now enter your newly setted password in the root account credentials section and click 'Test'.

Next section of this step is the PacketFence user account on the MySQL server. Simply leave the default pf username here and choose of a password. This one will automatically be set in the PacketFence configuration where you'll be able to retrive it in any case. Once the password entered twice, click 'Create user'.

Third section will create the database and load the correct schema on it. Simply leave the default and click 'Create tables and indexes'.

If you have 'Success' beside these three sections, click 'Continue'.

Step 4: PacketFence Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This step will configure the general options of your PacketFence installation. Theses are needed configurations that will most of the time fits customer specifications.

Almost all of the required information here are self-explanatory. The only one that could be confusing is the DHCP Servers section. In this one, enter a comma-delimited list of all the DHCP Server on the customer network so when PacketFence will see DHCP trafic originating from these IPs, no rogue-dhcp alerts will be triggered.

Click 'Continue' once all the fields are completed.

Step 5: Administration
++++++++++++++++++++++
This is the step where we create the administrative user to access the PacketFence Administration Web Interface.

Simply provide the desired username and password, then click 'Create user'.

Step 6: Services & Confirmation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The last but not the least. Here, we start the PacketFence server according to the configurations made in the previous steps. If everything goes as expected, you'll be prompted by a window inviting you to continue to the web administration interface.

You'll be able to login to the PacketFence web administration interface with the credentials created in Step 4.

Services status will help you monitor if everything goes as expected. If not, you'll see which service is in trouble and the log output will help you determine the problem that occurs.

Configuring Anyfi Gateway in PacketFence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that you have a fully functionnal PacketFence installation, you'll need to add the Anyfi Gateway to the PacketFence switches database for correct intergration.

To do so, login to the PacketFence web administration interface if it is not already done. Click on the 'Configuration' tab and select the switches section.

We'll use the clone function to add a new switch (the Anyfi Gateway) to the PacketFence database. With the mouse pointer, go over the default switch and you'll see a set of icons appearing at the left of it. Click on the second one (a paper sheet with a plus sign).

The 'Adding new switch' window will appear, in which, you'll enter the correct information for the integration. Use theses values to populate each of the fields; leave the others as is:

[options="compact"]
* *IP*: This will be the IP of the Anyfi Gateway on the customer management network
* *Type*: Anyfi Gateway
* *Mode*: Production
* *Vlans*: 2,3,10
* *Normal VLAN*: 10
* *Registration VLAN*: 2
* *Isolation VLAN*: 3
* *RADIUS Secret*: useStrongerSecret

Click 'Add switch'.

The newly added controller should shows up in the list.

PacketFence configuration is done. You may now reboot the demonstation PC (leave the USB key in). Once rebooted, the web browser should open in the PacketFence web administation interface.

Step 3: Configure Anyfi Gateway and Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This section will discuss about the configuration of your Anyfi Gateway and Controller in order to use it with our configured PacketFence environment.

Deploy Anyfi Controller and Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First thing, you will need to deploy the Anyfi Gateway and Controller on your network and configure basic connectivity between both of them.

When installing the Anyfi Gateway, have one interface in trunk mode for the packet bridge. In this example it will be `eth2` which is the last card on the machine.

Anyfi Gateway basic configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Connect to the gateway using SSH and enter configuration mode.
Now you need to add the configuration for `br0 which will link the access point traffic to your network.
    
    interfaces {
        bridge br0 {
            aging 300
            hello-time 2
            max-age 20
            priority 0
            stp false
        }
    }

In this example `eth1` will be the management interface of the Anyfi Gateway and `eth2` will be the interface that will contain the outbound WiFi traffic.

    interfaces {
        ethernet eth1 {
            address <your management ip address>/<mask>
            duplex auto
            smp_affinity auto
            speed auto
        }
        ethernet eth2 {
            bridge-group {
                bridge br0
            }
            duplex auto
            smp_affinity auto
            speed auto
        }
    }

Open SSID configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Still in configuration mode, configure the RADIUS server and SSID security.

    service {
        anyfi {
            gateway ma-gw {
                accounting {
                    radius-server <Management IP of PacketFence> {
                        port 1813
                        secret useStrongerSecret 
                    }
                }
                authorization {
                    radius-server <Management IP of PacketFence> {
                        port 1812
                        secret useStrongerSecret
                    }
                }
                bridge br0
                controller <IP or FQDN of the Anyfi Controller>
                isolation
                nas {
                    identifier anyfi
                    port 3799
                }
                ssid DemoOpen
            }
    }

Secure SSID configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Still in configuration mode, configure the Anyfi Gateway to broadcast a WPA2 enterprise SSID.

    service {
        anyfi{
            gateway secure-gw {
                authentication {
                    eap {
                        radius-server <Management IP of PacketFence> {
                            port 1812
                            secret useStrongerSecret 
                        }
                    }
                }
                bridge br0
                controller <IP or FQDN of the Anyfi Controller>
                isolation
                ssid DemoSecure
                wpa2 {
                }
            }
        }
    }


Deploy access point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You will now need to install CarrierWRT on a compatible access point and configure the Anyfi Controller in it. 
Depending on the access point you're using, the method to install CarrierWRT will vary.
For specifics about the CarrierWRT installation, refer to Anyfi's documentation.
Once this step is done, the SSID should be broadcasted.

Step 4: Configuration of Windows 7 client for DemoSecure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In 'Control Panel\Network and Internet\Manage Wireless Networks', click on 'Add' and 'Manually create a network profile'.

   Network name: DemoSecure
   Security type WPA2-Entreprise
   Encryption AES

Next, change connection settings. On 'Security' tab, click 'Settings', uncheck 'Validate server certificate'.

On the same tab, click 'Configure' and uncheck 'Automatically use my Windows logon name and password'.

Return on the 'Security' tab and click on 'Advanced settings'. On '802.1X settings', click on 'Specify authentication mode' and select 'User authentication'.

On '802.11 settings', uncheck 'Enable Pairwise Master Key (PMK) caching'.

Validate all the modifications and click on 'Close'.

Step 5: Test and Demonstrate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Congratulations, you have everything setup and ready!  If your setup is properly configured, you should be able to:

* reach (ping) the controller from the PacketFence environment
* see the DemoOpen, and DemoSecure SSIDs
* login the PacketFence administrative UI (`https://management_IP:1443`)
* connects a client device on the DemoOpen SSID using demouser/demouser credentials on the captive-portal
* connects a client device on the DemoSecure SSID using demouser/demouser credentials in the Windows network login dialog
