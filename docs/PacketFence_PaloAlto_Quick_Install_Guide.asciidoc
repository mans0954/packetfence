About this Guide
----------------
This guide has been created in order to help sales engineers, product managers, or network specialists demonstrate the PacketFence capabilities on-site with an existing or potential customer.  It can also provide guidelines to setup a proof of concept for a potential PacketFence deployment using the PaloAlto firewall.

Assumptions
-----------
* You have a configured PacketFence environment with working test equipment
* You have a PaloAlto firewall with PanOS 6


Quick installation
------------------
Step 1: Create a SSO role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will first need to create an SSO role on the web interface on the PaloAlto firewall.

Go to *Device -> Admin Roles -> Add*.

Create the role name 'SSO_Role', under the 'XML API' tab, enable everything and validate it with 'OK'.

Step 2: Create the account in PAN-OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now you have created the role, you will associate an user with it.

Go to *Device -> Administrator -> Add*.

[options="compact"]
* *Name*: xmluser
* *Authentication Profile*: None
* *Password*: xmluser
* *Role*: Role Based
* *Profile*: SSO_Role (Previously created)
* *Password Profile*: None

Step 3: Get the XML Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go on this URL: `https://@IP-of-PaloAlto/api/?type=keygen&user=xmluser&password=xmluser`.

It should display:

----
<response status="success">
<result>
<key>
LUFRPT1jeFV6SHd1QnJHaU55dnYvRlFNSkJNeTR6Uzg9TDgzNVlj0=
</key>
</result>
</response>
----

Step 4: SSO Configuration in PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that we have the key, we will configure the PaloAlto firewall in PacketFence.

Go to *Configuration -> Firewall SSO -> Add Firewall -> PaloAlto*.

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your firewall
* *Secret or Key*: LUFRPT1jeFV6SHd1QnJHaU55dnYvRlFNSkJNeTR6Uzg9TDgzNVlj0= (use the key previously generated)
* *Port of the service*: 443
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO with

Step 5: Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we will check that PacketFence is sending information when a user register on the portal. If the process worked, you will see the entry in the PaloAlto database.

Use SSH on the PaloAlto firewall and run this command:

----
admin@PA-VM> show user ip-user-mapping all

IP              Vsys   From    User                             IdleTimeout(s) MaxTimeout(s)
--------------- ------ ------- -------------------------------- -------------- -------------
