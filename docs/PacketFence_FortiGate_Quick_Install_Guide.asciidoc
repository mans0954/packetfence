About this Guide
----------------
This guide has been created in order to help sales engineers, product managers, or network specialists demonstrate the PacketFence capabilities on-site with an existing or potential customer.  It can also provide guidelines to setup a proof of concept for a potential PacketFence deployment using the *FortiGate firewall*.

Assumptions
-----------
* You have a configured PacketFence environment with working test equipment;
* You have a FortiGate firewall.


Quick installation
------------------
Step 1: Configuration of the RSSO Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go to your FortiGate administration webpage in *User & Device -> User -> User Groups -> Create New*.

[options="compact"]
* *Name*: RSSO_group
* *Type*: RADIUS Single Sign-On (RSSO)
* *RADIUS Attribute Value*: RSSO_Student (use the rolename of PacketFence, it's case sensitive)

You can also see that in the webpage at *User & Device -> Monitor -> Firewall*

Step 2: Configure the endpoint attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The default endpoint attribute is the Calling-Station-Id so the MAC address shows up under User Name, we can change that in CLI:

----
config user radius
edit RSSO_agent
set rsso-endpoint-attribute User-Name
end
----

Step 3: Activate the Accounting Listening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to *System -> Network -> Interfaces*.

Select the interface that will communicate with PacketFence and check 'Listen for RADIUS Accounting Messages' then confirm.

Step 4: SSO Configuration in PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to *Configuration -> Firewall SSO -> Add Firewall -> FortiGate*.

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your firewall
* *Secret or Key*: secret (radius shared secret)
* *Port*: 1813
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO

Step 5: Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to see if it's working, you can log into the firewall over SSH and run these following commands:

----
di debug enable
di debug application radiusd -1
----
