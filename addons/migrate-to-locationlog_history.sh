# Slowly migrate content of locationlog to locationlog_history
#
# Only useful if your locationlog is too big and you want to slowly move it 
# into locationlog_history and you do not want to do it in one batch like the 
# database-backup-and-maintenance script would do
#
# It will proceed day by day starting by the older entries first and sleeping 
# for 5 minutes between each batch.
#
# Usage: migrate-to-locationlog_history.sh <days>
# Where <days> is the number of days to migrate the records of.
